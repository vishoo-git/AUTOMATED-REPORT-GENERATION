DESCRIPTION:

Project: Data Analysis and PDF Report Generation
Project Overview:
This project involves developing a Python script that performs the following tasks:

Reads data from an input file (such as a CSV file).
Analyzes the data by performing basic statistics, such as calculating the mean, sum, and other descriptive statistics.
Generates a formatted PDF report that presents the analyzed data in a structured and professional manner. The report includes data summaries, charts (histograms), and statistical insights.
Key Objectives:
Data Processing: The script loads data from a file and performs basic analysis on the dataset.
Report Generation: A visually appealing PDF report is generated, which includes textual summaries and charts.
Automation: The process from data loading to report creation is automated, allowing for efficient analysis and reporting.
Core Components:
Reading Data from a File:

The script is designed to read data from a CSV file. You can customize it to handle different types of files (e.g., Excel, text files) if needed.
The pandas library is used to load the data efficiently and prepare it for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Basic statistical analysis is performed using pandas functions such as:
mean(): To calculate the average value of each column.
sum(): To calculate the total sum of the values in each column.
describe(): To provide a detailed statistical summary (including measures like standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles).
